      <h5>Template Notes</h5>
      <p>
        The main image can be changed by either replacing the current image with
        another one of the same size (900x402), or using a new one of what ever
        dimensions you'd like. If you choose the latter, you must open up
        style.css and change the dimensions of home.jsmainpic, as well as the file
        name if that is different. If you would like to move the heading around
        in the above image, find "home.jsmainpic h1" in style.css and modify it's
        "left" and "top" properties, this is also true for the h2 tag.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>More information</h5>
      <p>
        I decided to leave the content portion open for the templates users to
        do as they wish with a blank canvas. I don't like to restrict my users
        too much, and for this reason I leave the defining of any content
        related styles to you.
